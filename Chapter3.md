A poem for Sylvia:
Sylvia did not 
come to class today 
I miss Sylvia I hope 
she's okay.

By the way, I forgot to mention that there is a secret love plot taking place in the background of all of this stupid.
The secret love plot is that we all secretly love comp 225.

try picking your jaw up off of the floor for one measly minute and recognize the drama of this awesome story.
